I have imported import java.io.* import java.util.* and java.util.Scanner 
The java. util. Scanner import statement at the top of many Java classes means that somewhere in the code, the Scanner class is being used
import java.util.* means import all the classes and interfaces within java. util package and make them available to use within the current class or interface.
import java.io.* import's the input and output function's,and more we are used in file operation's like open close save etc

Command-line arguments in Java are used to pass arguments to the main program. If you look at the Java main method syntax, it accepts String array as an argument. When we pass command-line arguments, they are treated as strings and passed to the main function in the string array argument.
A data input stream lets an application read primitive Java data types from an underlying input stream in a machine-independent way. An application uses a data output stream to write data that can later be read by a data input stream.
Scanner is a class in java. util package used for obtaining the input of the primitive types like int, double, etc. and strings. It is the easiest way to read input in a Java program
Java BufferedReader is a public Java class that reads text, using buffering to enable large reads at a time for efficiency, storing what is not needed immediately in memory for later use.
Console class provides methods to access the character-based console device, if any, associated with the current Java virtual machine.
